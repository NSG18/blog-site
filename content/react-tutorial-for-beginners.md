## 1. Introduction to React

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It allows you to create reusable UI components.

### Why React?
- **Component-based architecture**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state.
- **Declarative**: Write simple views for each state of your application.
- **Fast**: React updates only the necessary parts of the DOM using its virtual DOM system.

---

## 2. Setting up the Development Environment

To start developing with React, you'll need:
1. **Node.js**: Download and install Node.js from nodejs.org.
2. **Code Editor**: Use VS Code or any editor of your choice.

Verify Node.js installation by running the following commands in your terminal: 
node -v
npm -v

After installing Node.js, you can use npx to create a new React project by running:
npx create-react-app my-react-app

Navigate into your project folder and start the development server:
cd my-react-app
npm start

---

## 3. Creating Your First React App

Now that you've set up your environment, let's create your first React app. When you run npm start, the development server will open a new tab in your browser. You should see the default React welcome screen.

The main files you'll be working with are:
- **src/index.js**: The entry point for the app, where React renders your components.
- **src/App.js**: The main app component, where you'll be writing your first component.

---

## 4. Understanding JSX

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML inside your JavaScript code. JSX makes your code easier to write and understand. Here's an example:

const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;

JSX gets compiled to regular JavaScript using tools like Babel.

---

## 5. Components and Props

In React, a component is a JavaScript function or class that optionally accepts inputs (called "props") and returns a React element that describes how a section of the UI should appear.

### Function Component Example:
``` javascript showLineNumbers
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

You can use this component by passing props:

<Welcome name="Sara" />
```
---

## 6. State and Lifecycle

State allows React components to change their output over time in response to user actions, network responses, or anything else. Here's an example using state:
``` javascript showLineNumbers
class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { date: new Date() };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.timerID = setInterval(
      () => this.tick(),
      1000
    );
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.timerID);
  }

  tick() {
    this.setState({
      date: new Date()
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
---

## 7. Handling Events

Handling events in React is similar to handling events in DOM elements. You can pass event handlers as props. Here's an example:

``` javascript showLineNumbers

<button onClick={activateLasers}>Activate Lasers</button>
```
React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase, and you pass a function as the event handler.

---

## 8. Conditional Rendering

React allows you to render different components or elements based on a condition. You can use JavaScript conditional statements like `if` or ternary operators.

Example:
``` javascript showLineNumbers
function Greeting(props) {
  const isLoggedIn = props.isLoggedIn;
  if (isLoggedIn) {
    return <h1>Welcome back!</h1>;
  }
  return <h1>Please sign up.</h1>;
}
```
---

## 9. Lists and Keys

In React, you can render a list of elements using JavaScript's `map()` function. Each item in the list needs a unique "key" to help React identify which items have changed.

Example:
``` javascript showLineNumbers
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
  <li key={number.toString()}>
    {number}
  </li>
);
```
---

## 10. Forms in React

Forms in React work similarly to HTML forms, but you can control their behavior using state. Here's an example of a controlled component:
``` javascript showLineNumbers
class NameForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { value: '' };

    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
  }

  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({ value: event.target.value });
  }

  handleSubmit(event) {
    alert('A name was submitted: ' + this.state.value);
    event.preventDefault();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          Name:
          <input type="text" value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />
        </label>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```
---

## 11. React Hooks

Hooks let you use state and other React features in function components. The most commonly used hook is `useState`. Here's an example:
``` javascript showLineNumbers
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
---

## 12. Using Effects

The `useEffect` hook lets you perform side effects in function components. It runs after every render by default, but you can control this behavior.

Example:
``` javascript showLineNumbers
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  }, [count]); // Only re-run the effect if count changes

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
---

## 13. React Router

React Router is a library that enables navigation between different views or pages in a React application. Here's an example of setting it up:

1. Install React Router:
``` blash
npm install react-router-dom
```
2. Set up routes in your app:
``` javascript showLineNumbers
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './Home';
import About from './About';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}
```
---

## 14. Conclusion

Congratulations! You've now learned the fundamentals of React, including JSX, components, state, events, hooks, and routing. Keep practicing by building more projects, and explore advanced topics like context, performance optimizations, and state management with libraries like Redux or Zustand.
