Welcome to this sample JavaScript tutorial! This guide will cover the basics of JavaScript, including syntax, variables, data types, functions, and more.

## Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. It is widely used for creating interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.

## Setting Up Your Environment

To start coding in JavaScript, you need a few tools:

1. **Text Editor**: Use a code editor like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom.
2. **Web Browser**: Most modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) have built-in JavaScript engines.

## Basic Syntax

### Variables

Variables are used to store data values. In JavaScript, you can declare variables using `var`, `let`, or `const`.
``` javascript  showLineNumbers
- var name = "Alice"; // Function-scoped
- let age = 25;       // Block-scoped
- const pi = 3.14;   // Block-scoped, cannot be reassigned
```
### Data Types

JavaScript has several data types:

- **String**: Textual data, e.g., "Hello, World!"
- **Number**: Numeric data, e.g., 42, 3.14
- **Boolean**: true or false
- **Undefined**: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value
- **Null**: Represents the intentional absence of any value
- **Object**: Complex data structures

### Operators

JavaScript supports various operators:

- **Arithmetic Operators**: +, -, *, /, %
- **Comparison Operators**: ==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=
- **Logical Operators**: &&, ||, !

## Control Structures

### Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow you to execute different code based on conditions.

``` javascript  showLineNumbers
let age = 20;

if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You are an adult.");
} else {
    console.log("You are a minor.");
}
```

### Loops

Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times.

#### For Loop
```javascript  showLineNumbers
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
```
#### While Loop
```javascript  showLineNumbers
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}
```
## Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.

### Function Declaration
``` javascript  showLineNumbers
function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name;
}

console.log(greet("Alice")); // Hello, Alice!
```
### Function Expression
``` javascript  showLineNumbers
const greet = function(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name;
};

console.log(greet("Bob")); // Hello, Bob!
```
### Arrow Functions

Arrow functions provide a shorter syntax for writing functions.
``` javascript  showLineNumbers
const greet = (name) => "Hello, " + name;

console.log(greet("Charlie")); // Hello, Charlie!
```
## Objects and Arrays

### Objects

Objects are collections of key-value pairs.
``` javascript showLineNumbers
const person = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 25,
    greet: function() {
        console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
    }
};

person.greet(); // Hello, Alice!
```
### Arrays

Arrays are ordered lists of values.
``` javascript showLineNumbers
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
console.log(fruits); // Outputs: apple
```
## DOM Manipulation

The Document Object Model (DOM) represents the structure of an HTML document. You can manipulate the DOM using JavaScript.
``` javascript  showLineNumbers
document.getElementById("myElement").innerHTML = "Hello, World!";
```
## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've reached the end of this sample JavaScript tutorial. You now have a basic understanding of JavaScript, including variables, data types, functions, objects, arrays, and DOM manipulation.

### Next Steps

- Practice coding by building small projects.
- Explore advanced topics like closures, promises, and async/await.
- Learn about popular frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.

Happy coding!
